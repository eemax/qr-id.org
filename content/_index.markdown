# The QR-ID Standard
A **Next-Generation Standard for Product and Instance-Level Identification**.  
QR-ID provides a revolutionary approach to item identification, combining the ubiquity of QR codes with the modularity and precision of advanced identification frameworks, such as GTIN-Batch-Serial formatted identifiers.

QR-ID is designed to:
- Simplify product tracking across supply chains.
- Enable granular instance-level identification.
- Provide flexibility for inventory, consumer engagement, and IoT applications.

## **Understanding the URL-Based Routing Framework**
The GTIN-Batch-Serial format is central to how QR-ID enables dynamic **URL-based routing.** This structure allows systems to interpret parts of the QR-ID code independently or holistically to meet varying use cases.

| **Action**              | **Logic Extracted**     | **Use Case**                                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **GTIN Only**           | `GTIN`                 | Access product-level information (e.g., inventory, reviews).  |
| **GTIN-Batch**          | `GTIN` + `Batch`       | Perform batch operations (e.g., recalls, quality checks).|
| **Full Code**           | `GTIN-Batch-Serial`    | Retrieve product lifecycle data, ownership, and unit-specific details.|

**Example Scenarios:**
1. **GTIN Only**:
   - What it retrieves: Generic product details like specifications, reviews, FAQs.
   - Who uses it: Retailers, consumers scanning codes in-store.

2. **GTIN + Batch**:
   - What it retrieves: Batch-specific data for recalls or quality assurance.
   - Who uses it: Manufacturers and logistics providers in supply chains.

3. **Full Code (GTIN-Batch-Serial)**:
   - What it retrieves: Granular unit details, including warranty registration, device tracking.
   - Who uses it: Consumers for warranty claims, IoT systems for updates.

This structured framework combines flexibility with precision, allowing QR-ID to adapt seamlessly across a wide range of industries.

## Why QR-ID?
QR-ID combines the **ease of QR codes** with modular data layering:
1. **Scalability**: Track global supply chains with flexibility, from GTIN-level down to unit serialization.
2. **Versatility**: Use QR-ID’s framework for anti-counterfeiting, IoT, and consumer engagement scenarios.
3. **Simplicity**: A single scannable code that works for everyone—manufacturers, logistics, retailers, and consumers.
