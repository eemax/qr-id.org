## **Abstract**

The **GTIN-Batch-Serial** standard is a next-generation approach to revolutionizing product and instance-level identification. By combining a **product code (GTIN)**, a **batch identifier**, and a **unique serial identifier** into a single structured format, this standard provides the flexibility, scalability, and modularity necessary for tracking, authentication, and consumer engagement. Using a separator (`-`) to distinctly organize GTIN, batch, and serial-level data, the approach embeds the complete identifier into a scannable QR code, enriched with logic-based routing. This white paper outlines the technical details, use cases, benefits, adoption strategies, and implementation roadmap for GTIN-Batch-Serial as a global standard.

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Motivation**

Modern supply chains and consumer ecosystems demand a global standard that supports precise product and instance-level identification. While existing standards such as GTIN provide batch or product-level traceability, they lack the ability to organize modular data layers or facilitate true unit-level serialization.

With industries adopting digital-first models and data-driven logistics, a unified approach that combines **product information**, **batch-level data**, and **unit-specific serialization** is essential. The **GTIN-Batch-Serial** format meets this demand, unifying these elements into a compact, structured identifier encoded into scannable QR codes.

### **1.2 Vision**

The GTIN-Batch-Serial standard aspires to:  
1. Deliver a **single scannable code** to work across inventory tracking, batch recalls, anti-counterfeiting, consumer engagement, and IoT integration.  
2. Simplify serialization and enhance hierarchical data layering across industries to minimize the need for multiple tags or codes.  
3. Enable data routing based on scan context, ensuring manufacturers, distributors, and consumers can securely retrieve the information they need.

## **2. Design of the GTIN-Batch-Serial Standard**

### **2.1 Format Overview**

The GTIN-Batch-Serial format uses a simple, structured pattern:  
```
[GTIN]-[Batch]-[Serial]
```

- **GTIN** (Global Trade Item Number):  
  Encodes the universal product identifier, covering standards already used for product classification worldwide (e.g., 12/13/14-digit codes).  

- **Batch**:  
  Provides batch- or lot-level information for production, quality control, and recall purposes. Batch identifiers are customer- or system-defined and may include alphanumeric characters.  

- **Serial**:  
  Represents a unique, unit-specific identifier (UID) assigned to each individual product instance. This is essential for single-item tracking, counterfeit prevention, and IoT use cases.  

- **Separator (`-`)**:  
  Clearly distinguishes GTIN, batch, and serial components for easy parsing by systems and applications.  

**Example**:  
- QR Code: `12345678901234-LOT5678-AA00123`  
  - `12345678901234`: GTIN (Global Product ID)  
  - `LOT5678`: Batch ID  
  - `AA00123`: Serialized identifier  

When encoded into a QR code:  
```
https://qr-id.org/12345678901234-LOT5678-AA00123
```

### **2.2 URL-Based Routing Framework**

The GTIN-Batch-Serial format leverages a **URL structure** for logic-based routing when scanned. On scan, systems can dynamically interpret and act on the GTIN, batch, or serial components separately or combined.  

| **Action**              | **Logic Extracted**     | **Use Case**                                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **GTIN Only**           | `GTIN`                 | Access product-level information (inventory, reviews).  |
| **GTIN-Batch**          | `GTIN` + `Batch`       | Perform batch operations (recalls, quality checks).     |
| **Full Code**           | `GTIN-Batch-Serial`    | Retrieve product lifecycle, ownership, and unit details.|

This URL-based routing allows the identifier to:  
- Dynamically connect to centralized or decentralized databases.  
- Enable contextual use cases, such as consumer-facing product information or manufacturer-specific traceability.  
- Provide encrypted interactions for sensitive data such as authentication or inventory control.

## **3. Use Cases**

### **3.1 Supply Chain Optimization**

- **Product and Batch Tracking**: Organizations use the GTIN and Batch sections for inventory and quality control.  
- **Serialized Shipping**: The Serial portion enables granular unit-level monitoring for logistics, reducing shipping errors.  

### **3.2 Consumer Engagement**

- **Interactive Packaging**: Consumers use scanners (e.g., smartphones) to reveal information encoded in the GTIN-Batch-Serial standard. For example:  
  - GTIN: Access product specifications, assembly instructions.  
  - Serial: Enable personalized interactions like warranty claims.  

### **3.3 Anti-Counterfeiting**

- **Unit Verification**: Serial identifiers protect against counterfeits by verifying the uniqueness of each scanned unit.  
- **Blockchain Integration**: GTIN-Batch-Serial can store product data on blockchain networks to create immutable, verifiable records.  

### **3.4 IoT Integration**

- **Serialized Device IDs**: IoT products encoded with GTIN-Batch-Serial can securely share firmware versions and configuration details.  
- **Cloud Access**: Enable dynamic retrieval of batch or serial-specific data such as maintenance schedules or error logs.  

### **3.5 Recall Management**

- **Scalable Recalls**: Use GTIN-Batch combinations to identify defective product lots and Serial data to isolate affected units faster.
